<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Database (CF) consists of 1239 documents published from 
1974 to 1979 discussing Cystic Fibrosis Aspects, and a set of 100 queries with 
the respective relevant documents as answers.</P>
<P>The original collection is available in a single <A 
href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/cfc/cfc.tar.gz">gzipped tar 
file</A> or a <A 
href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/cfc/cfc.zip">zip file</A> both 
of 1.47Mb, containing 7 document files and 1 query file.</P>
<P>The collection is also available in XML format also in a single <A 
href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/cfc/cfc-xml.tar.gz">gzipped 
tar file</A> or a <A 
href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hearst/irbook/cfc/cfc-xml.zip">zip file</A> 
both of 1.54Mb, including the Document Type Definition (DTD) for the collection 
and for each query/answer.

  <DD>The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and subheadings representing the major 
  subjects of the document. The Medical Subject Headings are shown in capital 
  letters and have been assigned by expert indexers. The two-letter symbols are 
  subject subheadings, also assigned manually from a controlled vocabulary (see 
  the MeSH vocabulary published by the National Library of Medicine). 
  <DT><B>Minor Subjects</B> 
  <DD>The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and subheadings representing the minor 
  subjects of the document. The Medical Subject Headings are shown in capital 
  letters and have been assigned by expert indexers. The two-letter symbols are 
  subject subheadings, also assigned manually from a controlled vocabulary (see 
  the MeSH vocabulary published by the National Library of Medicine) 
  <DT><B>Abstract/Extract</B>

<H2>Query Files</H2>
<P>Each query includes a query number and text, the record number of each 
relevant document in the answer, and relevance scores.</P>
<P>The relevance scores are from from 4 different sources: REW (one of the 
authors), faculty colleagues of REW, post-doctorate associate of REW, and JBW 
(other author and a medical bibliographer). 
<P>The relevance scores vary from 0 to 2 with the following meaning: <PRE>   2   HIGHLY relevant
   1   MARGINALLY relevant
   0   NOT relevant
</PRE>
<P>Example of a document answer: 513 &nbsp; 0010 <PRE>   Doc number: 513
   Relevance score by REW: NOT relevant.
